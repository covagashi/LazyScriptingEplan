---

Initializes the MergedFunction object to cover the functions passed in the array parameter. If the functions cannot be merged together into one merged function an exception is thrown. Functions, generally, cannot be merged together if they belong to different devices or they are of different categories. To be merged, they have to represent the same functional part of the device.
