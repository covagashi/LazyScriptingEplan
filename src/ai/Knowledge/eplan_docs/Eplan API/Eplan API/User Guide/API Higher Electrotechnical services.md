The  Eplan.EplApi.HEServices  namespace mainly contains functionality that is not directly connected to the data model. There are classes for backing up projects and master data, for creating reports or for printing. A lot of modules of EPLAN are represented in this namespace, such as the labeling module and the parts management.
