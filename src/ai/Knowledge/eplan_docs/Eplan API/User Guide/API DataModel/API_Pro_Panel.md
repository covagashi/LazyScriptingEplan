Eplan API currently provides users with access to Eplan Pro Panel objects. In general, any functionality that can be done via the user interface is also available in the API Pro Panel.

This chapter gives the user an overview of how API objects can be used in Eplan Pro Panel. The following pages show how to create particular objects and how they look in the GUI.

### Basics

API Pro Panel was created as an extension to the standard API DataModel (Eplan.EplApi.DataModelu.dll  assembly).

So there is a new namespace  Eplan:EplApi:DataModel:E3D  for 3D classes and  HEServices  methods that operate on them.

Usually it is enough to have Eplan Electric P8 to use API Pro Panel. However, some methods / properties however may require the installation of Eplan Pro Panel with appropriate license.
