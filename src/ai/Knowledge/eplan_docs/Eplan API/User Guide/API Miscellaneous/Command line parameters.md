**Remarks**

```

 By default, when starting P8 from command line with an action, no previously opened projects are opened at the beginning of the session.
 If your installation path is different from the default ("C:\Program Files\EPLAN\Platform\<version>\Bin"), you must modify the code samples below accordingly.
 "<version>" must be replaced with the correct Eplan version, e.g. "2026.0.3" for version 2026.
 
```

**Example**

```

    
 "C:\\Program Files\\EPLAN\\Platform\\<version>\\Bin\\EPLAN.exe" /variant:"Electric P8"

```

  

```

 If no user rights dialog is needed, the flag "NoUserRightsDialog" disables calling it. If user rights check fails, Eplan application will terminate.

```

  

```

 Use or borrow a License defined in "myLicense.lis". In "myLicense.lis" you can define a product variant and License modules to use or to borrow for a period of time.
 
 "C:\\Program Files\\EPLAN\\Platform\\<version>\\Bin\\EPLAN.exe" /License:"D:\\myLicense.lis"
