How to display a MessageBox with the Eplan window as owner

If you would like to display a message box or a modal dialog thatÂ uses the Eplan window as owner window, you can do this as in the following example:

```csharp
Process oCurrent = Process.GetCurrentProcess();
 var ww = new WindowWrapper(oCurrent.MainWindowHandle);
 MessageBox.Show(ww, "dialog with owner");
 MessageBox.Show("dialog without owner");
 public class WindowWrapper : System.Windows.Forms.IWin32Window
 {
  public WindowWrapper(IntPtr handle)
  {
  _hwnd = handle;
  }
  public IntPtr Handle
  {
  get { return _hwnd; }
  }
  private IntPtr _hwnd;
 }
```
