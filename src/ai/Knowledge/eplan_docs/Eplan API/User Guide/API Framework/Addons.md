Eplan has a modular architecture. This architecture system provides the possibility to expand the standard scope of Eplan by including additional functionality and changing existing functionality.

Add-ons enable the user to extend an installed version of Eplan. Using an add-on, you can basically distribute and centrally administer the following kind of data:

* Master data
* Settings
* API add-ins
* Scripts

When the Eplan version is started for the first time after an add-on has been installed, the new add-on is registered automatically to this Eplan version (if the add-on is set to  autoregister).

Add-ons can be installed and updated automatically or manually, locally or from a server.

Each add-on can be automatically registered as an API DLL. It is also possible to register a script when the add-on is registered.
