The user guide is a compilation of How-To-Dos, which describe, how you can use the Eplan API. It shows, how you can manage to write your own API applications, like [add-ins](AddIns.html) or [using Eplan in other applications](EplanInOtherApplications.html).

The user guide contains examples for some typical tasks, you perhaps want to automate in Eplan using the API. There are examples for [creating or opening Eplan projects](CreateOpenProject.html), for [creating pages](CreatePages.html) an [placing macros](HE_PlaceMacros.html), etc.

In contrast to the API Reference the user guide does not store detailÂ description of every API class.
