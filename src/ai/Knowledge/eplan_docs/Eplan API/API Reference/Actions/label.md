**Remarks**

```
        â¢ If the current selection in the project should be included in the output of the labeling, then you must use the /USESELECTION parameter.
        â¢ Microsoft Excel application is necessary to run Labeling with output file extension set to .xls (Excel format)
        â¢ When an error occurs during a label operation, a "BaseException" is thrown.
```

**Example**

```
label /PROJECTNAME:C:\Projects\EPLAN\EPLAN_Sample_Project.elk  /CONFIGSCHEME:config_scheme /FILTERSCHEME:filter_scheme  /SORTSCHEME:sort_scheme /LANGUAGE:en_US /DESTINATIONFILE:C:\temp\labeling.txt /RECREPEAT:3 /TASKREPEAT:2


Use the most recent configuration scheme: The CONFIGSCHEME parameter is not entered. It is empty.


label /PROJECTNAME:C:\Projects\EPLAN\EPLAN_Sample_Project.elk /FILTERSCHEME:filter_scheme /SORTSCHEME:sort_scheme /LANGUAGE:en_US /DESTINATIONFILE:C:\temp\labeling.txt /RECREPEAT:3 /TASKREPEAT:2


Carry out labeling without filtering and sorting: The FILTERSCHEME and SORTSCHEME parameters are not passed in this case.

label /PROJECTNAME:C:\Projects\EPLAN\EPLAN_Sample_Project.elk  /CONFIGSCHEME:config_scheme /LANGUAGE:en_US /DESTINATIONFILE:C:\temp\labeling.txt /RECREPEAT:3 /TASKREPEAT:2
