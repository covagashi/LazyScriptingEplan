```
 Unites net definition points placed on the same net in active project.
 
```

  

**Remarks**

```
 If more than one net definition point is placed on the same net, these NDPs (i.e. their connections) are combined into a single NDP.
 So after executing this action, each net will have at most one NDP containing all net-based connections of the net.
