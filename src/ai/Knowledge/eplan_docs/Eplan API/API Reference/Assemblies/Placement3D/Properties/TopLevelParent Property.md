Gets the root 3d placement from tree of 3d elements which this object is part of.

Syntax

**C#**
**C++/CLI**


public Placement3D TopLevelParent {get;}

public:

property Placement3D^ TopLevelParent {

   Placement3D^ get();

}


Remarks

Top level parent is being found by moving up in hierarchy of objects until a placement without a parent is found. In most case this will be layout space in which object is placed.
