---

Switching current (resistive load) # 26138.

Syntax

**C#**
**C++/CLI**


public MDPropertyValue ARTICLE_SWITCHING_CURRENT_RESISTIVE_LOAD {get; set;}

public:

property MDPropertyValue^ ARTICLE_SWITCHING_CURRENT_RESISTIVE_LOAD {

   MDPropertyValue^ get();

   void set (    MDPropertyValue^ value);

}


#### Property Value

Returns property value of type System.String.

Remarks

Maximum current for which an electrical device is designed and which a switch or relay can reliably switch if the load is purely resistive, i.e. has no inductive or capacitive component. Example: A relay has a switching current capacity of 10 amperes at 250 volts AC for ohmic loads. This means that the relay can safely switch 10 amperes at a voltage of 250 volts AC if the load is purely resistive.
