| **Explicit** | 3 | Message was output via another module and thus created "outside" of the message management (e.g., in the case of automatic cable generation, or when addressing PLC inputs and /or outputs). These module-specific messages are displayed together with the "normal" project check messages in the message management dialog |
| **Offline** | 2 | Message was output during project checking. In could be either GUI dialog 'Check project', API action 'check' or Check.VertifyProject method. |
| **Online** | 1 | Message was generated implicitly during project edition |
| **Undefined** | 0 | Available for older projects that did not have the types of check available at the time, or for the ones which no current project check has yet been performed |
