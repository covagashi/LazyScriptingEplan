In other words, the delete date of the second deleted object is output using the index [1]; the delete date of the third deleted object is output using the index [2] etc. The first deleted object has the highest index value. (The delete date of the last deleted object is output to the "Delete date" property (ID 36603).) The time is output in the local time of the user in accordance with the set time zone.
