**Source URL:** https://www.eplan.help/en-us/Infoportal/Content/api/2026/Eplan.EplApi.EServicesu~Eplan.EplApi.EServices.IMessage~GetMessageText.html

---

Called by EPLAN when the message text should be shown.

Syntax

**C#**
**C++/CLI**


string GetMessageText()

String^ GetMessageText();


#### Return Value

The message's text in correct language

Remarks

To allow multilingualism in Eplan projects, it's not the message text itself that will be saved in the project but well-defined properties which must be language independent. The function itself is responsible for getting the text in the correct language. Eplan provides special settings and functions to determine what language is actually used. The message text may contain place holders for substitution, e.g. "This here will be replaced: %1!s!" A place holder begins with '%' followed by a serial number. '!s!' will be replaced by the given text for substitution. The message text will be saved in the project message database and should be language independent. The text for substitution should be declared when the message will be added to the project. This message is called not only during a verification action but also when messages already existing in a project (generated by earlier verifications) have to be displayed.
