Exceptions

| Exception | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **ArgumentNullException** | NULL was passed as a parameter. |
| **ArgumentException** | Invalid object passed as a parameter. |
| **ApplicationException** | The internal interface could not be created. |
| [Eplan.EplApi.Base.BaseException](Eplan.EplApi.Baseu~Eplan.EplApi.Base.BaseException.html) | An error occurred while performing the action. Please refer to the exception message. |

Remarks

Component-specific data will be transfered from article to main-function, function template-data from article will be transfered to all functions of device, modules will be transfered to functions of device, when article is a module and main-function is a blackbox or plcbox, the referenced articles will be stored to project (if they were not before). Please be aware that not all values are overwritten by default with the ones from a part. In case of empty values, they don't overwritte existing ones. This behavior is similar to 'Conflict' dialog from GUI.
