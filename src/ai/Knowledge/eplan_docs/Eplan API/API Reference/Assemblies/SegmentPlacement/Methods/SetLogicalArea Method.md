Remarks

Logical area is a region where something that belongs to the object represented by the symbol can be placed in. This term applies only to some special kinds of functions - those having resizable symbol that encompasses other symbols (e.g. macro box, location box, a cable's shielding, cable definition line). Note: After setting the logical area with this method the [Eplan.EplApi.DataModel.SymbolReference.LogicalAreaSegments](Eplan.EplApi.DataModelu~Eplan.EplApi.DataModel.SymbolReference~LogicalAreaSegments.html) property returns an array containing 3 segments (that represent a rectangular area) Please remember that while changing LocationArea of shielding, symbol variant may be also changed. If original symbol variant number is 0 or 2 (horizontal) new variant number is set by comparing sign of old and new logical area offsets (Offset X = pEnd.X - pStart.X). If offset sign changed, symbol variant number is changed from 0 is 2 and vice versa. Analogically, if original symbol variant number is 1 or 3 (vertical) new variant number is set by comparing Y offsets and the variant number is changed or not.
