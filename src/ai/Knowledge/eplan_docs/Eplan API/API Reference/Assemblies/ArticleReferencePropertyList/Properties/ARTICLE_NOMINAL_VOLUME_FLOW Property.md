Remarks

Flow rate measured under defined nominal conditions. These are the conditions for which a device was designed with regard to its application when it is not under load. The nominal flow rate indicates how many volumes of a medium (e.g., air, water) flow through a system or a component per unit of time. These are usually specified in cubic meters per hour (mÂ³/h) or liters per minute (l/min).
