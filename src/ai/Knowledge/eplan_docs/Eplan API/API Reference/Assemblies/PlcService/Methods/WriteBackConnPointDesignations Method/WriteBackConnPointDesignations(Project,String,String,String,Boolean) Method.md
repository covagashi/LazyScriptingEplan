Remarks

'¢ The terminals must have a CPU name specified.  
'¢ The method corresponds to the "Write back connection point designations" dialog in P8.  
'¢ This functionality has been moved within the GUI: Up to version 2.8, it could be found under "Project Data" > "PLC" > "Write back connection point designations...". Since version 2.9, it is part of the project correction scheme in the GUI.
