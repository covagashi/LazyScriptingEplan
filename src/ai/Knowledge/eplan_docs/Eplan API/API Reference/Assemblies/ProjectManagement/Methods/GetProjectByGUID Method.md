Exceptions

| Exception | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Eplan.EplApi.Base.BaseException](Eplan.EplApi.Baseu~Eplan.EplApi.Base.BaseException.html) | Thrown if an error occurs while executing the method. |

Remarks

It may happen, that a project appears more than once in the database. This may for example happen, if the project was registered as well by a local path as by a UNC path. In this case, the path, which is found first will be written to `strProjectPath`. Opening a project via API does not registers it in the ProjectManagement database. Please use XPrjActionProjectUpdate action or [LoadDirectory](Eplan.EplApi.HEServicesu~Eplan.EplApi.HEServices.ProjectManagement~LoadDirectory.html) method in order to add it.
