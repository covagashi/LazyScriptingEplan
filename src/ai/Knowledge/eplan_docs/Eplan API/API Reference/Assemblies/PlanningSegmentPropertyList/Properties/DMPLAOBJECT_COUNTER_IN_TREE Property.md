Remarks

This property is read-only..

PCT loop functions that are subordinate to a PCT loop can be output by means of this property in reports in the same sequence as they are displayed in the tree view of the pre-planning navigator. You have to select this property as the "Category / property" in the sorting settings in the "Sorting" dialog so that the same sorting takes place in the reports as in the pre-planning navigator. This applies both for reports of the "Pre-planning: Planning object overview" (function lists for building automation to VDI 3814) type and for the export of manufacturing data / labeling data.
