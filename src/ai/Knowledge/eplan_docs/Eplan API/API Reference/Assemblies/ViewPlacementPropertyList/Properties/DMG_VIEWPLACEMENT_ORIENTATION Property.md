#### Property Value

Returns property value of type System.Int64.

Remarks

Rotates the content of the model view by 90°, 180° or 270° counterclockwise. This can be useful in order to make optimum use of highly-formatted model views on pages in landscape orientation. The border of the model view is not rotated. Texts in a model view that is rotated by 90° are rotated by the same angle. The exception are property texts to be read from the right. For them to remain legible, they are rotated by -90°.
