PLC inputs and outputs that are required for controlling can be defined at a planning object. When using the "PLC address: Symbolic address: UDT (name)" property specify the associated user-defined data type here. With these two properties you have the possibility to nestle and manage the symbolic address of the PLC connection point within a user-defined data type. "UDT" stands for "User Defined Type". The property is a monolingual text and is used and exchanged as of the AutomationML AR APC format Version 1.3.0. Entry of a decimal point is not permissible. The actual structure of the UDT is only required in the PLC configuration program and only specified there.
