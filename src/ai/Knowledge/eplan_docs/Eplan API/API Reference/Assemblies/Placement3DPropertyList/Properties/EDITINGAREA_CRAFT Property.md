0 = Electrical engineering

1 = Fluid power, general

2 = Mechanics

3 = Process engineering.

99 = General.

In this context, the "Fluid power, general" setting includes also the trades Hydraulics, Pneumatics, Cooling, and Lubrication. Pages contain the additional trade setting "General". The "General" trade is the default setting when generating report pages. If you filter defined working sections by certain trades, pages with the "General" trade are output along any other trade.
