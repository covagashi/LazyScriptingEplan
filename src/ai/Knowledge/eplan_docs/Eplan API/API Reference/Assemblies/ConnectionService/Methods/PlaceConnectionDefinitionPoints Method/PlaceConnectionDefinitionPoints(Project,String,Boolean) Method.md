Automatic optimization of nets and connections routed in them.

Syntax

- [C#](#i-syntax-CS)
- [C++/CLI](#i-syntax-CPP2005)

```
```
public bool OptimizeNetAutomatically( 

   IEnumerable<Connection3D> colConnections3D,

   int nMinSize,

   bool bPartiallySelected,

   bool bCloseDaisyChains

)
```
```

```
```
public:

bool OptimizeNetAutomatically( 

   IEnumerable<Connection3D^>^ colConnections3D,

   int nMinSize,

   bool bPartiallySelected,

   bool bCloseDaisyChains

)
```
```

#### Parameters

*colConnections3D*
:   Collection of 3d connections for which net optimalization will be done. Can't be null.

*nMinSize*
:   Specifies the number of connections per net that is to trigger an optimization. The minimum number is 2.

*bPartiallySelected*
:   If true then all nets included in collection completely or partially are optimized.

*bCloseDaisyChains*
:   If true then an additional connection from the first to the last connection point of the chain is generated.

#### Return Value

True if operation has been finished without problems. If false then check system messages for more information about problem.
