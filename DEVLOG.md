# Development Log

## 2025-08-13: ADK Integration
- Migrated from custom agent architecture to Google's Agent Development Kit
- Restructured project for ADK compatibility
- Improved agent orchestration and tool integration

## 2025-08-12: Another architecture pivot
- Testing google ADK and CrewAI

## 2025-08-11: Agent Architecture Challenges
- Mini-agents approach showed significant flow issues
- FileSystemAgent couldn't handle complex coordination
- Investigated A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocols as alternatives

## 2025-08-08: System Integration
- Implemented complete multi-agent system
- Added fallback loops and error handling
- System partially functional, debugging agent communication flows

## 2025-08-07: Agent Enhancement
- Enhanced all specialized agents
- Separated RAG into documentation and script-specific systems
- Added planning agent (non-coordinator role)
- Focused on balance between functionality and complexity

## 2025-08-06: Architecture Pivot
- Workflow proved insufficiently intelligent for dynamic scenarios
- Case sensitivity and small changes broke agent coordination
- Complete architecture redesign with improved agent separation
- RAG system temporarily broken, requires rebuild

## 2025-08-05: RAG Improvements
- Switched to 'sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2' for embeddings
- Significantly improved RAG effectiveness
- KnowledgeAgent now successfully finds information
- ManagerAgent provides better context
- **Pending**: JSON data cleaning and CodeGeneratorAgent testing

## 2025-08-04: RAG Struggles
- Continued difficulties with RAG system implementation
- JSON parsing approach proving inadequate

## 2025-08-02: LLM Strategy Shift
- Pivoted from local LLM (Qwen) to Gemini 1.5 API
- Better performance but RAG system still challenging

## 2025-07-30: Project Inception
- Initial concept: C# implementation with local LLM
- Discovered difficulties with local LLM integration in C#
- Successful EplanRemoting test with Python
- Decision: Python for better LLM ecosystem compatibility
