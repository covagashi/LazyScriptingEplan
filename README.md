# Dev-Log

30/07/2025
My first idea was to build it with C# but I really had difficulties when I try to use a local LLM.
I did a quick test and EplanRemoting works fine with python. So I will use python because is more friendly
when comes with LLM

02/08/2025
I am stuck with the RAG system, I am not sure if the qwen is nnot enought.
I am thinking to pivote towards Geminis 1.5 API instead of a local LLM

04/08/2025
I moved to geminis and it's better but I still struggling with the RAG
